These are the free Mac desktop tools I use daily for tasks like drafting blogs to managing servers and building apps.

I normally use a Mac, so a few of these tools are pretty Mac-centric.

## Mou

[Mou](http://mouapp.com/) is a markdown editor that gives you a preview in real time and allows you to edit your `.md` files with beautiful syntax highlighting.

## iTerm 2

[iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/) is one of the first apps I install when I set up a new Mac. I love the split pane and that can go between tabs with command+arrow keys. The tab Expose helps me keep track of sessions. Growl keeps me updated with bells and issues. It's really quite wonderful.

## Adium

I use [Adium](http://adium.im) for most of my chat needs (if it supported Skype and I didn't have friends that only used Skype it would be 'the one'). I can be connected to multiple chat servers (XMPP and Google Chat) and keep all the live chats open in a wonderful tabbed interface. By default it supports encryption, so I can chat away with my more paranoid friends.

## SPF13 Vim and MacVim

Vim isn't Mac centric, although, I do use [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/) for the copying and pasting and overall gui goodness.

For a long time, I was configuring Vim on my own. I was updating `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc` files constantly, researching and installing plugins, trying to make it work for everything always. Then, one day, I decided to try out the curated and tested configuration that [SPF13-Vim](http://vim.spf13.com/) provides, created a `.vimrc.local` and `.gvimrc.local` and never looked back.

If you are so inclined, feel free to check out my [SPF13 Vim configuration](https://gist.github.com/mimiflynn/9144157#file-vimrc-local) and [SPF13 Vim MacVim configuration](https://gist.github.com/mimiflynn/9144157#file-gvimrc-local).
