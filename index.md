## Desktop Mac

I normally use a Mac, so a few of these tools are pretty Mac-centric.

### Mou

Mou is a markdown editor

### SPF13 Vim

For a long time, I was configuring Vim on my own. I was updating `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc` files constantly, researching and installing plugins, trying to make it work for everything ever always. Then, one day, I decided to try out this curated and tested configuration, created a `.vimrc.local` and `.gvimrc.local` and never looked back.

If you are so inclined, feel free to check out my [SPF13 Vim configuration](https://gist.github.com/mimiflynn/9144157).

### iTerm 2

[iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) is one of the first apps I install when I set up a new Mac. I love the split pane and that can go between tabs with command+arrow keys. The tab Expose helps me keep track of sessions. Growl keeps me updated with bells and issues. Its really quite wonderful.

### Adium

## Desktop Linux

I love using Ubuntu when I can (aka when I don't need photoshop).
