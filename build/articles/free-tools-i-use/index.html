          <section class="content"><p>These are the free Mac desktop tools I use daily for tasks like drafting blogs to managing servers and building&nbsp;apps. </p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I normally use a Mac, so a few of these tools are pretty&nbsp;Mac-centric.</p>
<h2 id="mou">Mou</h2>
<p><a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a> is a markdown editor that gives you a preview in real time and allows you to edit your <code>.md</code> files with beautiful syntax&nbsp;highlighting.</p>
<h2 id="iterm-2">iTerm&nbsp;2</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm 2</a> is one of the first apps I install when I set up a new Mac. I love the split pane and that can go between tabs with command+arrow keys. The tab Expose helps me keep track of sessions. Growl keeps me updated with bells and issues. It’s really quite&nbsp;wonderful.</p>
<h2 id="adium">Adium</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> for most of my chat needs (if it supported Skype and I didn’t have friends that only used Skype it would be ‘the one’). I can be connected to multiple chat servers (<span class="caps">XMPP</span> and Google Chat) and keep all the live chats open in a wonderful tabbed interface. By default it supports encryption, so I can chat away with my more paranoid&nbsp;friends.</p>
<h2 id="spf13-vim-and-macvim"><span class="caps">SPF13</span> Vim and&nbsp;MacVim</h2>
<p>Vim isn’t Mac centric, although, I do use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> for the copying and pasting and overall gui&nbsp;goodness.</p>
<p>For a long time, I was configuring Vim on my own. I was updating <code>.vimrc</code> and <code>.gvimrc</code> files constantly, researching and installing plugins, trying to make it work for everything always. Then, one day, I decided to try out the curated and tested configuration that <a href="http://vim.spf13.com/"><span class="caps">SPF13</span>-Vim</a> provides, created a <code>.vimrc.local</code> and <code>.gvimrc.local</code> and never looked&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>If you are so inclined, feel free to check out my <a href="https://gist.github.com/mimiflynn/9144157#file-vimrc-local"><span class="caps">SPF13</span> Vim configuration</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/mimiflynn/9144157#file-gvimrc-local"><span class="caps">SPF13</span> Vim MacVim configuration</a>.</p>
