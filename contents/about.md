This site was made by me, [Mimi Flynn][1], with [Wintersmith][2].

I'm a software engineer living in NYC. I enjoy rock climbing, camping, cycling, music, and driving long distances across the country.

None of the links on this site are affiliate links. Buy where you want. I just want to share a few of my favorite things.

If your interested in checking out everything I've ever read on the internet go to [PulleyAndRope][3].
