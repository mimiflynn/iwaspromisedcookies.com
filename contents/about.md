My name is Mimi Flynn and I've been working with the web for 15 years. These are my thoughts regarding the internet.

Currently located in New York, NY but tend to spend time in Austin, TX and Denver, CO when I find the chance.

I enjoy rock climbing, cycling, and paddle boarding. Recently been getting more and more interested in hammocks and the art of the hang.
